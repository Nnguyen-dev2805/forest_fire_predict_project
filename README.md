# Algerian Forest Fires Prediction

This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts the risk of forest fires in Algeria based on environmental parameters. It uses a **Ridge Regression** model trained on real-world data to provide accurate and reliable predictions for the Fire Weather Index (FWI).

## Features

- Predicts Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) using user-input environmental factors.
- Interactive web interface built with **Flask** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Model trained on the Algerian forest fire dataset.
- Easy-to-use form for entering temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and other relevant features.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run the following command to install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Start the application**  
   Run the Flask application with:
   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser**  
   Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the prediction interface.
